abstract: 'Open-source software (OSS) is widely spread in industry, research, and government. OSS represents an effective development model because it harnesses the decentralized efforts of many developers in a way that scales. As OSS developers work independently on interdependent modules, they create a larger cohesive whole in the form of an ecosystem, leaving traces of their contributions and collaborations. Data harvested from these traces enable the study of large-scale decentralized collaborative work. We present curated data on the activity of tens of thousands of developers in the Rust ecosystem and the evolving dependencies between their libraries. The data covers seven years of developer contributions to Rust libraries and can be used to reconstruct the ecosystem s development history, such as growing developer collaboration networks or dependency networks. These are complemented by statistics on downloads and popularity, tracking the dynamics of use and success over time. Altogether the data give a comprehensive view of several dimensions of the ecosystem.'
