title:  Active Learning and Active Control of Growth Complexity in Naming Games
author: W. Schueller, P.-Y. Oudeyer
shortwhere: Proceedings IEEE ICDL-Epirob 2015

abstract: 'Naming Games are models of the dynamic formation of lexical conventions in populations of agents. In this work we introduce new Naming Game strategies, using developmental and active learning mechanisms to control the growth of complexity. An information theoretical measure to compare those strategies is introduced, and used to study their impact on the dynamics of the Naming Game.'
