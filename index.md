I am currently working as a postdoc at the [Complexity Science Hub Vienna][csh], studying systemic risk in food supply chains and in Open Source Software ecosystems. I have responsibilities in several projects as a data engineer, and am also helping with IT system administration in general. One of my goals as a researcher is to promote higher standards of reproducibility of science where software and data are involved.
